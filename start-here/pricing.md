<details>

<summary>Who is Clay made for?</summary>

Clay is made for sales ops, demand generation, and growth teams looking to find more leads, faster. Our spreadsheet makes it easy to pull in leads from dozens of sources and enrichment to find almost any data possible.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are Clay enrichment credits?</summary>

Clay is reshaping the data provider business model by bundling together 25+ different providers into a simple credit system for a fraction of the cost.&#x20;

Each month you're given a certain amount of credits depending on your plan (Basic, Explorer, or Pro). Every time an enrichment provider is called, it counts as 1 credit. For example, if your table includes 3 enrichment columns, then every row added will run 3 credits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do enrichment credits roll over each month?</summary>

No. Currently right now our enrichment credits do not roll over each month.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is Clay able to offer so many enrichment providers at a low cost?</summary>

We offer a simple monthly subscription at a fraction of the cost of most single data providers. This is because we buy our credits in bulk, so you can get them for much cheaper without signing onto large, unnecessary commitments. You can pick and choose the best tools for your prospecting flow :)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are Premium enrichments? Why is this a separate package?</summary>

We bundle together the majority of our data providers as “Basic enrichments” that are built into your plans; however, we connect with more traditional enrichment tools such as People Data Labs, Hunter, Owler, and Clearbit. While you can connect your own API key to these tools, we also offer credit packages to get access to these more expensive providers at a lower cost. See the section above on Premium enrichments to learn if it’s right for you.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does Clay enrich both accounts and contacts?</summary>

Yes! You can start with data for either to enrich:

* Accounts: URLs, company LinkedIn profiles, Crunchbase profiles, or company name
* Contacts: name, email, LinkedIn profile, Twitter profile, etc.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does Clay’s Chrome Extension work? Is it included in my plan?</summary>

Yes. Clay’s Chrome Extension makes it easy to scrape and import data from any website in a few simple clicks. For example, you can scrape lists from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ycombinator.com, and much more.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is Clay different than People Data Labs or Clearbit?</summary>

Unlike Clearbit, People Data Labs, ZoomInfo, and other enrichment services, we are not a data provider. We connect with 50+ data providers into a simple prospecting tool so you can build workflow automations, build enrichments on top of each other, score leads, and connect with your existing stack.Clay makes it possible to do wicked multi-enrichments such as using Google API to find a LinkedIn profile, then using a LinkedIn data to pull in their profile information, then using the company page to pull even more information. You'll never have to rely on just one data provider for your information again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I get charged a credit if no data is found? What if there's an error?</summary>

If there's an error, then you will not be charged any credits. However, there are a few exceptions that "No Data Found" will charge credits. For instance, if we call Google's API and search open role counts, if the result is 0, this still counts as a run. Similarly for job role count, tech stack, and a few other integrations that "No data found" is helpful, this will charge a credit. All other enrichments such as find email, enrich Linkedin, etc. will only run if data is returned.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do my credits rollover each month?</summary>

Currently credits do not rollover each month for Clay's enrichment credits. However, premium credits will rollover each month.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I get charged credits if I bring my own API key?</summary>

No, you're not charged credits if you bring your own API key.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I connect my CRM or outbound tools to Clay?</summary>

Absolutely. We can connect with over 100+ outbound tools and CRMs to help automate your prospecting or enrich your leads. This is included within the product.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do credits count for things that I OAuth into?</summary>

No, currently there are no credit charges for things you OAuth into.
