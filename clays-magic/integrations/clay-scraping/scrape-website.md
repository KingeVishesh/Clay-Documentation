Scrape Website is used for getting email, social links, and phone numbers from a website. To Scrape Websites, click on Add Integrations and select `Scrape Website`.

* **URL -** The website you want to scrape.

After running, It will result in a lot of fields like the body and all the links on the page. You can then map them to other fields. You can scrape any website using the tool without having to worry about mapping the fields like in Get Data From Page.
