# Map your own list

If the list you want isn't yet mapped, or is already mapped but missing some attributes, create your own! Try this out on **any** page with structured data, e.g. Twitter followers, an e-commerce product page, an online database you've been eyeing.

**For example:**

1\. Head back to [zora.co](http://zora.co/)

2\. **Enter Select List mode.** Hit the Chrome Extension and head over to the **Select Data** tab > **Select Data on Page** button > **Select a list** option

**3. Set your list parameters.** Select two similar items from the list one after the other, e.g. two titles, two images, two descriptions.

**4. Get mapping!** Name your list, select the attributes you'd like to pull, save them as you and watch Clay find the rest.

5\. **Export your new list.** As easily as hitting **Copy to Clipboard** or **Export as CSV.**
