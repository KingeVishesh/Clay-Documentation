# What integrations does Clay offer?

Clay offers three primary types of integrations:

* **Enrichment integrations**: connect to data providers to enrich people or companies (e.g. Clearbit, People Data Labs, Owler)
* **Internal tooling:** sync to your internal tooling to update/create contacts, lookup usage, send emails (e.g. Hubspot, Salesforce, Customer.io, SendGrid)
* **Third party open APIs:** any company that has an open API we can integrate with! Some of the most common include Twitter, Github, Shopify.

You can find the [full list of integrations available here](https://clay.com/integrations), and if you have a tool you'd like to integrate, just let us know!
