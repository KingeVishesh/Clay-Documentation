# Clay Scraping

Clay has two types of web scrapers, `Get Data from Page` & `Scrape Website.` Scrape Website allows you to scrape information like emails, phone numbers, and keywords from any webpage. Whereas Get Data From Page can scrape any kind of data from websites that have recipes made. You can use the [Clay Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clay-for-chrome/acmfklpkefjlldbkdgmjoiknfgidadoh) to create recipes on any website, or you could ask clay to map the page [here](https://tally.so/r/w5Bab6).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are scraping **1000 websites** then you probably have to use **Scrape Website.**

If you are scraping **1000 webpages** of the same site then you probably have to use **Get Data From Page.**
