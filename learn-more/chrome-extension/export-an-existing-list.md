# Export an existing list

When you land on any page that contains a list interesting to you, you can check to see if it has been automatically detected or already mapped by the Clay team, and **Copy to Clipboard** or **Export to CSV**.

Pages we suggest testing out include LinkedIn People or Jobs Search, Google Jobs Search, or a list of speakers from your favorite conference.

#### For example:

1. Navigate over to [zora.co](http://zora.co)
2. **Get started.** Open up the chrome extension
3. **Capture the full data.** Scroll to see the existing auto-detected list of brands
4. **Export your list. Copy to Clipboard** or **Export as CSV**
