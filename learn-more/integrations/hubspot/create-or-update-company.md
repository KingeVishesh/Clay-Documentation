Using Clay's HubSpot integration, you can create or update contacts within your CRM by using the information you found via Clay. To do this, just use our "Create or Update Contact" integration, map the columns you'd like to update your CRM with, and then run the integration. Your HubSpot contacts will be automatically updated from there. Happy prospecting!
