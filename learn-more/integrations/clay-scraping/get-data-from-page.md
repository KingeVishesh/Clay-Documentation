Get Data from Page allows you to scrape structured data from any website. To add Get Data From Page, click on Add Integrations and select `Get Data From Page`.

* **URL -** The webpage you want to scrape.&#x20;
* **Delay Time -** Time to wait before scraping the page. Having a higher delay time will increase how much time it takes to process all rows.

After running, It will show you the structured data scraped from the webpage. Which you then can map to other fields. You can scrape any listing or product page, given that the website has been mapped. The mapping can be either done by you or you can ask us to get it mapped for you.
