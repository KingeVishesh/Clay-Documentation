The "Get Keyword" function in Clay Enrichments allows you to find specific keywords in any body of text. Whether it's the description in someone's social profiles or the body text of a website, you can find keywords that match the specific parameters you're looking for.

To run this function, simply run the "Get Keywords" function in the integrations panel and type in the keyword(s) you're looking for. Then, select the text that you'd like to scrape, and then Clay does the rest!
