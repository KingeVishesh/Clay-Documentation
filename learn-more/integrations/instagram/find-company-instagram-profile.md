Using Clay, you can find a company's Instagram profile using just a company domain and name. In this video, Patrick uses some LinkedIn profiles to find a person's company Instagram.

To do this, just find a company's name and domain name, open up the integration, input the aforementioned information, and if the company website has an Instagram link then it will populate within the Clay table. Happy prospecting!
