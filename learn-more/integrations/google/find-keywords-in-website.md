With Find Keywords In Website integration you can take a domain name and keywords to find if the keywords exist on a website.&#x20;

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the domain name and the keywords, and then save changes. Once you run the integration column it will take some time to get the data. Then you can access all the information about google search results and pull any data you want.
