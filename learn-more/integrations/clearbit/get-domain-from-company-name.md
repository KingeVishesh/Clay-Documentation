This integration helps get the website domain of a company from the company name. It is free and doesnâ€™t require any premium credits.&#x20;

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the company name and save changes. Once you run the integration column it will run instantly. Then you can map the first domain to a new column.&#x20;
