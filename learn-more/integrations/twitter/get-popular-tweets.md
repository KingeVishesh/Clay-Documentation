In this video, Patrick outlines how to quickly map out a list of popular tweets from certain Twitter users. Our "Find Popular Tweets" integration makes this as easy as a few clicks.

To do this, go to "Enrich Data" and find the "Find Popular Tweets" integration. From there, just input a user's Twitter URL, define parameters if you'd like, and map out as many top tweets as you'd like. Happy prospecting!
