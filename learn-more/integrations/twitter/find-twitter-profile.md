In this quick video, Patrick shows us how to use the Find Twitter Profile enrichment. This can be used to quickly find the Twitter accounts of potential prospects using just their name and company name.&#x20;

To do this, just go to "Enrich Data", open the "Find Twitter Profile" enrichment, enter the recommended information (person's name, company name, handle/URL), and run the enrichment. Your column will then be populated with the profile information of your prospects, which can then be mapped to your table for further use. Happy prospecting!
