Want to quickly get emails and URLs from blurbs of text? Clay has enrichment for exactly that. Just put the text you want to scrape through in one column and run the "Extract URLs and Emails from Text" enrichment found in the integrations panel. Once you've done that, you can map out any of the information found through the enrichment into further columns. &#x20;
