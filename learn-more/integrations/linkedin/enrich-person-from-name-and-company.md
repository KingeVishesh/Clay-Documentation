The "Enrich Person from Name and Company" function is a great way to pull data from potential prospects. All that is required is a name and company URL- then run the integration.&#x20;

After the integration is run, you can pull several data points from the enrichment to map to your table, such as experience, company domains, and more. Happy prospecting!
