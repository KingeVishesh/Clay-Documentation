With LinkedIn Enrich Company integration you can take a website, Company LinkedIn URL , LinkedIn Company ID or Sales Nav URL to get data points like phone number, HQ location, and more about the company.

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the domain name and save changes. Once you run the enrich company column it will populate within a second. Then you can access all the information about the company and pull any data that you want.
