# Get Dapp

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/17a505eea950465a82040c3537efb858" %}

Our "Get Dapp" integration allows you to retrieve data from any dapp given a dappradar dappID. The dappid is unique to the DappRadar platform and allows you to transfer dapp data to platforms like Clay. Here's how to do it:\
\
First, navigate to "Enrich Data" and find our "Get Dapp Data" integration. You'll notice that the two inputs are "Dapp ID" and "Blockchain", the latter of which is optional. To find the dappid, go to the page you'd like to get data from, click "About", and the DappId will be displayed there. \
\
Once you've copied the DappIds into a column, throw that column into the matching input box. You can then select the blockchain that you'd like data for; if you don't select one, the integration will run for all chains. You can also select a timeframe if you'd like, and if you don't it will default to 24 hours. From there, you can save changes and run the integration. Happy prospecting!
