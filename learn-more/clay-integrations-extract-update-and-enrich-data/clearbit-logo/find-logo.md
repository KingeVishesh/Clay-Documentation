This quick and simple Clearbit integration allows you to pull logos from any company website. Just run the "Find Logo" action in the integrations tab, select your column of domains as the source, and the logos will be automatically mapped for you on Clay.&#x20;

After finding the logos, you can then either leave them as-is or map the logo URLs to your Clay page as well.&#x20;
