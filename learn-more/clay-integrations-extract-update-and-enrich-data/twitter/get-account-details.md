Clay's "Get Account Details" Twitter integration allows you to find info such as follower count, status counts, profile URL and more, easily accessible to work with the rest of your Clay data. All it requires is a name and Twitter URL!

To use this integration, visit the "Enrich Data" tab on Clay and look-up the "Get Account Details" Twitter enrichment. From there, just input the user's Twitter URL and run the integration. Once completed, you can map whatever info you deem necessary out to your Clay table. We hope this helps, and happy prospecting!
