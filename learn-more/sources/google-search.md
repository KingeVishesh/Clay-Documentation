Clay's Google source allows you to pull specific data from a Google Search into your Clay Table for enrichment. To do this, access the "Google Search" source through the Import Data tab. Once that's opened, there are several queries ranging from simple to more complex that you can input to scrape Google for data.&#x20;

Once you've searched Google for specific data, you can then map it to your Clay table and use our 50+ integrations/enrichments to get whatever information you need. Happy prospecting!
