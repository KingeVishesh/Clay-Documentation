1. Navigate over to the **Sources** button in your table of choice\

2. Select **LinkedIn** from the list of sources\

3.  Set up your required inputs, note that **only one input is required** for the source to work:

    * **Set your limit:** the source defaults to 100 records and caps out at 250 (contact us to increase the cap!)
    * **Set one or more inputs:** Enter the title, location, experience, etc you would like to query Linkedin for. \
      \
      **ðŸš¨ Note that you can only enter one option per input, e.g. one location, one title for the time being -- we will be enabling multiple comma separated options soon!**

    ****
4. **You're all set**! Create new tables with new sources, add more LinkedIn sources into existing tables, and more.
