Google keyword searches can be used for prospecting. The steps have been discussed using the example of finding a company that offers paid family leave solutions.

First you need to run a search query by putting the company domain and then insert a backslash and add careers. The careers page will talk about the benefits of the company. To search for parental leaves on a certain website you run it on the google keywords integration and it will give you information on the number of days of paid parental leave. This might be useful if you're selling parental leave software, as it will help in personalising emails and highlighting how your programme is a better fit for their company.
