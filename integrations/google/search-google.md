The Google search integration can be used to find  LinkedIn profiles with only the name and the company. You have to input the name and company, followed by linkedin.com in quotes and backlash to limit the results to LinkedIn alone. You can limit the number of results and localize it to any location you like and run it. After mapping it to the table you can enrich the data and do a lot more.
