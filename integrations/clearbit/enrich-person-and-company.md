Clearbit Enrich Person & Company allows you to get information about any person or company using their work email. It will return information like their LinkedIn profile, bio, and more. This is similar to Clearbit Enrich Company integration which takes domain as the input but it do not return any personal information.

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the email and save changes. Once you run the enrich person and company column it will populate within a second. Then you can access all the information about the person and the company and pull any data that you want.
