With Clearbit enrich company integration you can take a domain name and get datapoints like LinkedIn, phone number, HQ location and more about the company.&#x20;

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the domain name and save changes. Once you run the enrich company column it will populate within a second. Then you can access all the information about the company and pull any data that you want.
