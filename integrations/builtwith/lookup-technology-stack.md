With BuiltWith Lookup Technology Stack integration you can take a domain URL and insert keywords to get info on whether a company uses certain technology or not.

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the domain name and keywords and save changes. Once you run the Lookup Technology Stack column it will populate within a second. Then you can access all the information about the company and pull any data that you want.
