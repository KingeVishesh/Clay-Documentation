With People Data Labs integration you can input any information about the person like the Email, a Social Link, or name and the company. It will result in information like LinkedIn, phone number, HQ location, and a lot more information about the person.&#x20;

To get started, add the integration on a table and map the data points you want to send and save changes. Once you run the enrich person column it will take couple of seconds to get filled. Then you can access all the information about the person and pull any data that you want.
