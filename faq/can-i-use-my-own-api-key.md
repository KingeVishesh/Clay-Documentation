# Can I use my own API key?

If you have your own API key for any integration, you are welcome to use it in Clay.

While Clay has partners on our premium enrichments, we do have numerous actions available that we've been built out as users have requested them to use with their own plans (e.g. ZoomInfo, Anymail Finder, etc).
